# PhysicsEngine

Hey!!!
This project consists (at the moment) of 3 fundamental Physics simulations that
I've tried and implemented in C++ using SFML as my visualization library.I am 
aware that what I've done is of fundamental knowledge but I thought it would be
pretty cool to try and test my C++ skills.
The simulations provided:
1) Falling Ball (verlet + semi-implicit euler integrations)
2) Gravity Source + Particle (basic particle revolving around a gravity source)
3) Simple Pendulum

I am looking forward to improving the code and, eventually post a "better" version
of what I've done already, consisting of more types of simulations and maybe a starting screen.
(to be easier to interact with).

Thanks for reading!!!!
